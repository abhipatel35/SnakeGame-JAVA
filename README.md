# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in Java using Swing. The game window is a grid where the snake moves around. The objective is to eat the red apples that randomly appear on the grid, which causes the snake to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the grid.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.
